# ItemPriceUpdate_Ava
Just a Python Script for Ava, updating prices 


Item Price:

This script is written in Python and uses the requests library to make a GraphQL API request to the Tarkov.dev API. The script prompts the user for a list of item types and validates that the input is a comma-separated list of valid item types. Then it makes a GraphQL query to the API to retrieve data for the specified item types. The data returned by the API is parsed and processed to get the items with the highest prices. The highest prices and other item details are then written to an output file called "output.txt." The script also prints the elapsed time it took to execute the script.

Custom Item List:

Same as above just diffrent format.
